# Still Face Coder

Still Face Coder is a Python repository created to code the [Face-to-Face Still-Face Paradigm](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/ed-tronick-and-the-8220-still-face-experiment-8221/) using Deep Neural Networks. The coding is based on the standardized instructions of the [Infant and Caregiver Engagement Phases Revised](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325689546_S1_File/data/5b1e646c45851587f2a01303/pone0194763s001.pdf) (ICEP-R) manual. 

There are four DNN models in the repository with different variations of train-test splits: 

•	SF-80: 80% training, 20% test
•	SF-50: 50% training, 50% test
•	SF-25: 25% training, 75% test 
•	SF-10: 10% training, 90% test 

## Usage

The Python files can be downloaded and run on a local machine or executed in the browser with Google Colab.
